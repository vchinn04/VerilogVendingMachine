## Verilog Vending Machine

This project is a vending machine created for a Nexys3 FPGA using Verilog. The core functionalities include 
cycling through items to see their stock and prices (depending on current mode), inputting coins/cash, and 
purchasing items if enough cash was inputted and the stocks are not empty.
