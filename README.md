## Verilog Vending Machine

This project is a vending machine created for a Nexys3 FPGA and a 16 button keypad using Verilog. The core functionalities include 
cycling through items to see their stock and prices (depending on current mode), inputting coins/cash, and 
purchasing items if enough cash was inputted and the stocks are not empty. 

The report and module descriptions are in the [LabReportAndDescriptions.pdf](https://github.com/vchinn04/VerilogVendingMachine/blob/main/LabReportAndDescriptions.pdf) above.
